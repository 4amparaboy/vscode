### Easy Installation

To install the color themes, just use the extensions tab within VS Code and search for 'Rainglow'.

Once installed, themes can be switched using the menu item `Code -> Preferences -> Color Theme`.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repository into `~/.vscode/extensions` and restart the editor.

### Useful Information

This project is an evolution of my colour schemes project found at [https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). Peacock was the first ever theme. I created it to try and find something to use other than Monokai. It's now a favourite for many users!

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a wonderful day!
